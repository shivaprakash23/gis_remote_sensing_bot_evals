    {"role":"assistant","content":"The most frequently used index for vegetation mapping is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is defined as:
       NDVI = (B2 - B1) / (B2 + B1)
       where, B2 represents the brightness values (i.e., the digital numbers, or pixel values) from an infrared band of an image, and B1 represents the corresponding values in the image’s red band"}

    {"role":"assistant","content":"Remote sensing is the acquisition and measurement of information about certain properties of phenomena, objects, or materials using a recording device not in physical contact with the observed features. While this broad definition includes medical tools like X-rays and MRIs, in an environmental context, remote sensing refers to the recording of electromagnetic energy from the Earth's surface, oceans, or atmosphere. These environmental applications allow scientists to identify, delineate, and differentiate surface features by their electromagnetic properties."}

    {"role":"assistant","content":"Satellites provide the advantage of capturing large geographic areas in a single observation. They also revisit the same areas on a regular cycle, enabling consistent monitoring over time. This temporal resolution allows tracking of dynamic changes such as urban expansion, glacial retreat, or deforestation. The data collected is geospatially referenced, making it suitable for integration with other geographic datasets in GIS systems.

    {"role":"assistant","content":"Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional and are linked through the equation:
        C = λ × ν,
        where C is the speed of light (~300,000 km/s), λ is the wavelength, and ν is the frequency. As wavelength increases, frequency decreases, and vice versa.

    {"role":"assistant","content":"A spectral signature is the unique pattern of electromagnetic reflectance or emission that an object or material exhibits. These distinct spectral profiles enable remote sensors to differentiate between materials such as vegetation, water, and urban surfaces. This capability forms the foundation for classification and analysis in remote sensing.

{"role":"assistant","content":"Passive sensors detect naturally occurring electromagnetic radiation that is either reflected by the Earth's surface (e.g., sunlight) or emitted by objects (e.g., thermal radiation). They do not emit any energy themselves. In contrast, active sensors generate their own electromagnetic energy (e.g., radar or LiDAR), which is directed toward the Earth's surface. The sensor then measures the energy reflected back to it. This allows active sensors to operate day or night and in various weather conditions."}

  {"role":"assistant","content":"Photogrammetry involves obtaining reliable spatial measurements from aerial photographs. These measurements may include distances, heights, and area extents of features. It has evolved from using film-based aerial photos to employing digital images and even satellite data. Though the book focuses more on non-photogrammetric remote sensing, photogrammetry has historically been crucial for cartography and topographic mapping."}
