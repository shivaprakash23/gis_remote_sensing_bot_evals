    {"role":"assistant","content":"The most frequently used index for vegetation mapping is the Normalized
       Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is defined as:
       NDVI = (B2 - B1) / (B2 + B1)
       where, B2 represents the brightness values (i.e., the digital numbers, or pixel
       values) from an infrared band of an image, and B1 represents the corresponding
       values in the image’s red band"}

    {"role":"assistant","content":"Remote sensing is the acquisition and measurement of information about certain properties of phenomena, objects, or materials using a recording device not in physical contact with the observed features. While this broad definition includes medical tools like X-rays and MRIs, in an environmental context, remote sensing refers to the recording of electromagnetic energy from the Earth's surface, oceans, or atmosphere. These environmental applications allow scientists to identify, delineate, and differentiate surface features by their electromagnetic properties.

    {"role":"assistant","content":"Satellites provide the advantage of capturing large geographic areas in a single observation. They also revisit the same areas on a regular cycle, enabling consistent monitoring over time. This temporal resolution allows tracking of dynamic changes such as urban expansion, glacial retreat, or deforestation. The data collected is geospatially referenced, making it suitable for integration with other geographic datasets in GIS systems.

    {"role":"assistant","content":"Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional and are linked through the equation:
        C = λ × ν,
        where C is the speed of light (~300,000 km/s), λ is the wavelength, and ν is the frequency. As wavelength increases, frequency decreases, and vice versa.
